    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a student at Drexel University studying User Experience and Interaction Design. I have a variety of interests and would like to apply them throughout my career. My first year of college, I explored multiple different majors and found multiple ones interesting. However, once I discovered UXID, I knew it was the right choice.</p>
    <p>Something very important to me is having a more global outlook. Whether you have a global audience or not, it is important to acknowledge all of the different cultures and needs around us and make sure that products are accessible to everyone.</p>
    <p>I have had the opportunities to explore my UX and UI abilities by managing and designing websites, and smaller projects such as interactive flyers. I have also been able to put my skills towards more technical projects such as writing and formatting contracting estimates and emails.</p>
    <p>Outside of UXID, I enjoy exploring Philly, learning about modern cultures from around the world, playing video games, and &#40;of course&#41; spending time with my friends and family.</p>
